The goal of this project is to predict, for any person given a set of medical and demographic features, whether they have heart disease or not. For this analysis, we will be using a machine learning model that was trained on data in heart.csv format. The outcomes were visualized using a pie chart that indicated the number of people who had heart diseases and those without, along with their average ages.
Now, we'll assume that a similar machine learning model, say a classifier such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest, is trained on heart disease data. The model will be used to predict whether the subject has heart disease or not.The predictions are put in a new column called predictions, and the predictions are going to be used further for analysis.
